## Student Groups

1/16/24:
  Finished all graphics and uploaded them to Basecamp. We can start focusing our attention on coding now. We also made our game simpler, and told Jaina that she doesn't need to make helicopter sounds.


1/29/24:
  We have made our sprites bigger and also coded the prisoner and guard animations. We also made a hitbox to work with, so we know when the prisoner is hiding or when he is caught. We just need to make a working rotating background, as well as the start, victory, and end screen.
